I'm a PhD candadiate in computational neuroscience, mentored by [Dr.Terrence Sejnowski](https://cnl.salk.edu) at Salk. [My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7xTBMSkAAAAJ&hl=en) focuses on causality detection in time-series data and modeling computation principles in neural circuits. Check out my latest network causality estimation algorithm: [Dynamical Differential Covariance (DDC)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.18.448901v2).

Besides lab research, I'm broadly interested in **AI algorithms, theories (and puzzles)**. During the years, I accumulated pages of [research notes _(network dynamics, causality estimation, ICA algorithms)_](./notes.html) and [side projects _(Object recognition, SLAM, puzzle sovling!)_](./projects.html) and equivalently two M.S. degrees! 

I'm posting them here so that they don't have to go through the painful and lengthy review process to qualify as publications. If anyone is interested in these material, feel free to drop me an email 



Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
